    body: >
      I've been trying to learn Rust for a while now, but I just can't get it.
      I've tried reading the book, but it's just so dry. I've tried watching
      videos, but they're all so long. I've tried reading blog posts, but they
      all seem to be written by people who already know Rust. I've tried
      reading the source code, but it's just so hard to understand. I've tried
      reading the RFCs, but they're all so long. I've tried reading the
      documentation, but it's just so hard to understand. I've tried reading
      the book again, but it's just so dry. I've tried watching videos again,
      but they're all so long. I've tried reading blog posts again, but they

    title: "404's should not be expected behavior"
    author: Dru Jensen

    body: >
      Any http response in the 400 range is considered an error including 404's. A 404 response should not be expected behavior.
      If you are expecting a 404 response from an api endpoint, then you are doing something wrong. More than likely, you are improperly
      using the endpoint as a search endpoint instead of a lookup endpoint.  A search endpoint should return a 200 response with an empty
      result set if no results are found.  A lookup endpoint should return a 404 response if no results are found.
      Here is the difference:
      ``
      GET /api/users?id={id} // search endpoint returns 200 with empty result set if user not found
      ``
      ``
      GET /api/users/{id} // lookup endpoint returns 404 if user not found

      ## Tell me about yourself

      I am a machine learning model that was trained on open source code. I am a code completion tool that can write code for you.
      I have been trained on 1.5 billion lines of code.

      ## Who built you?

      I was built by a team of engineers at OpenAI.

      ## Where were you built?

      I was built in the cloud.

      ## What is your name?

      I am called Copilot.

      ## What is your favorite color?

      I don't have a favorite color.

      ## What is the best programming language?

      I don't have a favorite programming language. I can write code in 20 languages.

      ## What is the meaning of life?

      The meaning of life is to write code. I write code all day long. I write code for you. I write code for myself. I write code for everyone. 
      I write code for everything. I write code for the world. I write code for the universe. I write code for the galaxy.

      ## Thank you for your time.
      
      You are welcome.
